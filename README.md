# **Nayru's Pokedex Project: BETA PHASE**
- Branch: ***Nayrus-Pokedex-BETA***
- Custom Pokemon? Custom changes? Don't want to use a dinky text file to show your players all this information?
- This Pokedex will read directly from data structures and show the contents.
- You don't need to do anything besides edit your base stats files, evoatttack, and eggmove tables as you otherwise would when customizing your own version of Crystal. Fully compliant with Fairy Typing.

*Bundled:* [Idain's](https://github.com/Idain) [Custom Dex Colors](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Customizable-Pok%C3%A9dex-Color) and [Toggle Shiny Palettes](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Option-to-show-shiny-colors-in-Pok%C3%A9dex), doesnt impact you if you dont want it.

*REQUIRED:* (bug/design flaw fix about Radio Tower)
- [Unique Mon Icons](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Add-a-new-party-menu-icon) (or at least adapt to the new Bank structure, actual icons used are irrelevant)
- [Replace StatExp with EVs](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Replace-stat-experience-with-EVs),
- [Expanded Tilesets to 255](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Expand-tilesets-from-192-to-255-tiles), 
- my Gen3 Type/Status/Cat Tiles. Pokedex portion must be implemented. Other parts, optional.

FEATURES:  Base stats and info, Move Info, Detailed area info, Evoulation chart, and sprite page showing animated sprites (reflects shiny toggle too).

Move Information: Lvl-Up Moves -> Field Moves (plus lvl learned and/or TM/HM/Move Tutor) -> Egg Moves -> TMs. I have fully functional code commented out to include HMs. But I decided not to since Field Moves serve the same purpse. But, if you've messed with adding or deleting Field Moves, I reccomend scrapping the Field Moves code and restoring the HM code. Please feel free to DM about this if it's an issue. I'm working on better solutions at some point.
Move Page Future Ideas: Full Page toggle option, to show additional details about the moves, Type, power, category, accuracy, effects, etc

AREA Pages: Currently supports Johto/Kanto Walking/grass/surfing encounters plus their swarms. Fishing Rods information is also included. Right now, all it will show you is the relevant Fishing Group Name. In the near future, it will print Route information like the other pages.
To check your local Fishing Group, check your PokeGear.

POKEGEAR: Now shows the detailed name of map you're currently in (based on Map Group & Map Number) and it also reads the map's attribute to see it's fishing group, if it has one.

COMING SOON: AREA support for Headbutt Trees and Rock Smash Rocks and the Bug contest. Roaming Support for the dogs and any custom roamers.

I also have an idea to have a python script scrape all information about special event pokemon (like Celebi, Ho-oh, Lugia, Starters, Casinos, Gift pokemon like Eevee) and NPC trades and displaying that. The script should be run if you ever make edits to these and will recompile the list. I should probably do this for Field Moves too, since people can and do have custom Field Moves...

Feel Free to DM me any suggestions and feedback. If you want to help me design Tiles/GFX to help make everything easier to look at, I would be eternally grateful.

# Allow using a Field Move (HMs, Dig, Teleport, etc) if the Pokemon can learn it
